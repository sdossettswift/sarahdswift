            <h2>Pleasure to see you</h2>
            <p>
              I am Sarah Swift. I am a Texan, daughter, younger sister, licensed attorney, friend, amateur chef, wanderlust writer who is learning to code. You might call me a flibbertigibbet or a dilettante. My mom calls me "Princess Pineapple".   I call myself curious and happy.</p>
              <p>Though I live in Houston, my heart is in Sewanee, Tennessee, on a mountain where I played lacrosse, studied religion, learned to love bourbon, and finally got Shakespeare.</p>
              <p>
                I come from a long line of entertainers and I have been known to gather 60 carousers in less than 600 square feet. I live with my childhood best friend in Houston's Historic Sixth Ward. Our china cabinet is full of party hats which invariably come out when the punch bowl gets low.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I am sad, I remind myself that every couple I have set up has gotten married; I saved a drowning child's life; my unassuming face compels strangers to tell me their secrets; and my internet research skills are peerless.
              </p>
              <p>
                My itchy feet have taken me across northern Spain, up the Appalachian Trail, around the Annapurnas, and deep into the Grand Canyon. My most exciting adventure is the one I am on right now: creating the life of my dreams.
